REF: vgat-TRN_Selective optical drive of thalamic reticular nucleus generates thalamic bursts and cortical spindles

The implant was attached to a custom-designed stereotaxic arm and lowered to the craniotomy. Thalamic
stereotrodes were lowered to the following stereotaxic coordinates (M/L 1.9mm, A/P 1.7mm, D/V -3.5mm) which positioned the fiber optic at approximately the following coordinates (M/L
2mm, A/P 1.7mm, D/V -3.25mm) and neocortical stereotrodes at (M/L 3.25mm, A/P 1.7mm, D/V -0.5mm)
