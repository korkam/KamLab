Description:
Use Conformal Coating to protect head stage

1. Mask: Cover up any connectors, pins, switches or buttons that you will need to use with clay puddy.

2. Mix a generous amount of epoxy that you are using as per directions. You want enough to give a thick coating over the entire board. You will need to work fast as the epoxy that I used set in about 5mins. 

3. coat: use tootpick or swabs to mix and apply.

4. After dry, inspect the board for any places you might have missed. You might need to do another thin coar to cover up any places.
